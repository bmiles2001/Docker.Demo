# Docker Demo
This project was intended as a way for me to learn about Docker and Docker containers.

# How do I use it?
First, install Docker for Windows.
Then, in the Demo folder, you can run `DemoDockerCompose.bat` to show using Docker compose.
You can also instead run `DemoStack.bat` to see the app running using Docker swarm.

# Whats the point of this app
It's a simple app that shows a Client getting data from a Server.
I wanted to show how we can spin up multiple clients and servers and have them talk using Docker.
